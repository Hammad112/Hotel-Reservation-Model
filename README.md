## Student Performance Predictive Model using Linear Regression
### Overview
This project aims to predict student performance based on various features using a linear regression model. The process involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Model Training, and Hyperparameter Tuning.


1. **Introduction**
Predicting student performance can help educational institutions identify students who need additional support and improve overall educational outcomes. This project utilizes a linear regression model to predict student performance based on various features such as study time, previous grades, and demographic information.

2. **Data Collection**
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to student demographics, study habits, and previous academic performance. The dataset is assumed to be pre-collected and stored in a CSV file named student_performance.csv.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA involves understanding the data by visualizing distributions, correlations, and relationships between features. Key steps include:

- Importing necessary libraries
- Loading the dataset
- Checking for missing values
- Visualizing data distributions
- Analyzing correlations between features and the target variable
4. **Feature Engineering**
Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance. Steps include:

- Encoding categorical variables
- Creating new features (if applicable)
- Normalizing or scaling numerical features
5. **Model Training**
The linear regression model is trained using the processed dataset. Steps include:
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Training the model on the training set
- Evaluating the model on the testing set
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
Hyperparameter tuning involves optimizing the model parameters to achieve the best performance. Common techniques include:
- Grid Search CV

7. **Evaluation**
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. Visualizations such as residual plots may also be used to assess model performance.

8. **Conclusion**
The project concludes with a summary of findings, model performance, and potential improvements for future work.
